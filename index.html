      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        I am an accomplished team leader and plant breeding scientist with over a decade of experience 
        managing R&D initiatives in small grains, legumes, and clonally propagated aromatic crops. 
        I thrive in collaborative environments, overseeing projects from conception to completion 
        and aligning them with strategic goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work combines strategic planning, technical innovation, and mentorship. 
        I’ve built high-performing teams, secured funding for complex research programs, 
        and delivered measurable outcomes in plant variety development and functional genomics.
      </p>
      <p>
        With expertise ranging from molecular genetics to large-scale field trials, 
        I focus on advancing agricultural science, developing improved crop varieties, 
        and fostering innovation that benefits both industry and academia.
