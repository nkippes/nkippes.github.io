#### Research
During my PhD in the [Dubcovsky lab at UC Davis](https://dubcovskylab.ucdavis.edu/home) I studied  the genetic regulatory networks that module developmental growth in wheat with a focus on vernalization requirement and photoperiod response. As a PostDoctoral Researcher and Project Scientist, in the [Comai Laboratory](https://comailab.org/) at the [UCD Genome Center](https://genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/), I led the development and implementation of genetic and genomics tools to initiate plant breeding of an orphan crop with an emphasis on flavor quality, disease resistance, and oil yield.
